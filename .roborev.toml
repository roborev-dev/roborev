The daemon and client evolve in lockstep, and the daemon is restarted after
updates and so API changes do not require backward compatibility shims, and
we do not expect newer clients to be able to talk to older daemons at the
present time.

TUI overflow on very narrow terminals (e.g. 60 characters wide or less) is acceptable
and so please omit pedantic comments on these extreme scenarios.

This is a local CLI tool. The daemon runs on localhost, the database is local SQLite,
and all displayed data (repo names, branch names, paths) originates from the user's
own filesystem and git repos. Do not flag injection or sanitization issues for data
that never crosses a trust boundary. Reserve injection findings for content from
external sources (e.g. commit messages from shared repos, API responses from remote
services).

The TUI talks to the daemon over loopback HTTP. Do not flag thundering-herd or
rate-limiting concerns for local loopback requests unless the number of concurrent
requests scales with untrusted input or external data. A bounded number of requests
proportional to the user's tracked repos is acceptable.

Git hooks (pre-commit, commit-msg, post-checkout, etc.) are the user's own scripts
running on their own machine. Hook stderr forwarded to agents or printed to the
terminal is local-only data that does not cross a trust boundary. Do not flag:
- "prompt injection" from hook output passed to agent prompts
- "secret exposure" from hook stderr being logged or forwarded to the model
- "unbounded capture" of git command stderr (git stderr is practically bounded)
These are the same class of local-data-in-local-tool issues covered above.
