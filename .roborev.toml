The daemon and client evolve in lockstep; the daemon is restarted after
updates. API changes do not require backward compatibility shims.

TUI overflow on very narrow terminals (< 60 chars) is acceptable; omit
pedantic comments on these extreme scenarios.

## Trust model — local-only tool

roborev is a single-user local CLI. The daemon binds to 127.0.0.1, the
database is local SQLite, and all data (repo names, paths, review content,
hook output, job metadata) originates from the operator's own filesystem and
git repos. Only flag injection/sanitization issues for data from external
sources (e.g., commit messages from shared repos, API responses from remote
services). The following are all local-data-in-local-tool and are NOT
security findings:

- Missing auth on daemon endpoints (only client is the local CLI; OS-level
  access control is sufficient)
- "DoS" from request bodies or thundering-herd on loopback (bounded by the
  user's own repos, not external input)
- "Data exposure" from endpoints returning review content (user's own data
  on their own machine)
- "Prompt injection" from hook stderr, prior review text, or agent output
  embedded in prompts (all locally generated; a compromised local agent
  already has full shell access)
- "Secret exposure" from hook stderr logged or forwarded to the model
- .githooks/ tracked as a supply-chain risk (source templates only; installed
  hooks are frozen copies in .git/hooks/, unaffected by branch switches)
- Race conditions in metadata handoff between CLI and daemon (correctness
  concern, not exploitable by external attacker)

## Config loading and filesystem fallback

Config loading (loadGuidelines, loadCIRepoConfig) reads .roborev.toml from
the default branch and falls back to the working-tree filesystem when the
default branch has no config (no remote, config not yet committed). The
daemon never checks out PR branches — the working tree is always the
operator's own checkout. Do not flag filesystem fallback as a trust-boundary
issue or claim that PR authors can influence config via the working tree.
