Analyze the provided code for complexity issues and suggest simplifications.

Your task:
1. Identify complexity hotspots:
   - Functions with high cyclomatic complexity
   - Deeply nested control flow
   - Complex boolean expressions
   - Functions with too many parameters
   - Large switch statements or if-else chains
2. Assess cognitive load for each complex area
3. Suggest specific simplifications

Output format:
- **COMPLEXITY HOTSPOTS:** List functions/areas with complexity indicators
- **COGNITIVE LOAD ISSUES:** Parts that are hard to understand at a glance
- **SIMPLIFICATION SUGGESTIONS:** Concrete ways to reduce complexity
- **TRADE-OFFS:** Any trade-offs to consider (performance, flexibility, etc.)
